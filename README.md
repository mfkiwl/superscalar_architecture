# Superscalar Architecture
The Repo is a 16-bit microprocessor based on a superscalar architecture with fetch width of two Instructions and four different pipelines in VHDL. The architecture is based on a Turing Complete ISA with 17 Instructions and was successfully verified by simulation using Modelsim.
