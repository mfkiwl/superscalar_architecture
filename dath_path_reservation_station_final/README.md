# superscalar_architecture


This is the final code which was shown to TA's All the the arithmetic logical dependencies have been resolved.Even dependencies between two consecutive instructions fetched have also been resolved.

Carry , flag zero flag issues also resolved. Note that only LM,SM have not been implemented and branch instructions are not always giving correct results.

We tested this design with a complicated nest of ADC,ADZ ,ADD instructions in front of TA and got all correct results.
